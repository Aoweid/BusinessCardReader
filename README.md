# BusinessCardReader
If you use the git hub version, you must have tomcat installed on your Eclipse Enterprise Edition first to run the application!
The object of this project is to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and NLP (Nature Language Processing) to collect useful information from business card images, including name, phone number, email, fax and address. Users only need to upload digital pictures of business cards onto the website and in several seconds, they would have the information they need. Here is the link: www.businesscardreader.com 
It is easy to use the website. Upload one business card image, choose display all image and press OCR result button. Thatâ€™s it!
This project can be extended to achieve more ambitious goal, such as reading mortgage contracts and retrieving useful information which may save hundreds of dollars per contract from paying someone to process them. There still a lot of improvement can be made for this project because of limited time. 
Thank you for trying the business card reader!
